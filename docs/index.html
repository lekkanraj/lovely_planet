            <p>
              In the early days of humanity, we observed nature in its various facets. This included the movement of heavenly bodies, the flight patterns of birds, changes in weather patterns, ocean waves and flow of water in water bodies, shedding of leaves in trees and autumnal change of color in leaves, the life cycles of plants and animals and their behaviors. Their life was tied closely to nature.

              <p class="description">
              	Astronomy, the study of planets and stars is the oldest science.  From the earliest days of human civilization, people used to observe the sky, relate it with their culture, and do calculations to predict the future positions of the heavenly bodies.
              	</br></br>
              	In the past humans have looked into the sky to navigate across the oceans, to decide when to plant crops, to calculate time and to find out where we came from in this vast universe. With the help of technology our understanding of the heavenly bodies has progressed and we have found that the basic elements in our body are the same as those in the stars. The technological developments in astronomy have become essential in our day to day life with applications like personal computers, communication satellites, mobile phones, Global positioning systems, solar panels and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.
              </p>
              <h5>Real life applications:</h5>
              <ul class="ul-li-content">
	              <li>CCD- Charge coupled device, an instrument which converts the movement of electrical charge into a digital value used in many of our mobile phones and cameras today , was originally developed for astronomy to study celestial images</li>
	              <li>Satellite observations of Earth has helped us study better about the climatic changes, find new ecosystems, report forest fires in unknown places, find landslide threats during heavy rains.</li>
	              <li>NASA’s technology which was used to study weak data signals and huge amounts of noise in space has already saved the life of four people buried in debris after an earth quake in Nepal by identifying their breathing and heartbeats.</li>
	              <li>NASA’s technology in thermal vacuum chamber, originally used to create artificial space environments on earth, has found its application in medical field to freeze bone marrows to prevent damage during transplants.</li>
	              <li>Satellites designed for Earth observations have been designed to locate people in distress worldwide, whether from a plane crash, a boating accident or other emergencies.</li>
	              <li>Tracking and data relay satellites (TDRS) have solved the problem of communication with researchers in Antarctica faced in 1990’s.</li>
	              <li>An air scrubber technology developed for space is widely used on Earth as air purifiers.</li>
	              <li>The most commonly used astronomy derived invention is the wireless local area network, initially used to sharpen images from a radio telescope.</li>
	              <li>The first calendars were based on the movement of moon in the sky. The atomic clocks used today were calibrated using astronomical ephemeris time to redefine the value of a second.</li>
	            </ul>
	            <p class="description">
	            	Our team will promote astronomy through class room sessions, one- day workshops, night sky observations and many other activities.

              <h4 class="title text-center"><a href="">BIRD WATCHING</a></h4>
              <p class="description">
              	Bird watching or birding is a recreational activity open to all age group of people.  The migrations and habits of birds tell us a great deal about the changing conditions in the environment and the availability of essentials such as food and water. Of course, birds are also a beautiful and diverse group of animals which are easier to view than other kinds of creatures. 
              </p>
              <h5>History</h5>
              <p class="description">
              	The early observation of birds started in the late 18th century. They were observed for their beauty and eggs. The call for bird protection started in the late 19th century leading to the popularity of observation of birds. The Audubon society was started in the United States and the Royal society for protection of birds in Britain to protect the birds from feather trading in the late 19th century.
              	</br></br>
              	Initially bird watching was a hobby undertaken in the developed countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom, after the second half of the 20th century many people from developing countries have started engaging in this activity.
              	</br></br>
              	There are about 10,000 species of birds and very little people have seen more than 7000 of them. The first who started observing the species of birds was of Stuart Keith.
              	</br></br>
              	Birding started in India with the work of Salim Ali, the legendary Indian ornithologist.
              </p>
              <h5>Benefits of Birds:</h5>
              <ul class="ul-li-content">
	              <li><strong>Bird help to fertilize flowers:</strong> The birds which help in fertilizing flowers are called as “pollinators”. Humming birds, spiderhunters, honeyeaters are some of the common bird pollinators.</li>
	              <li><strong>Pest control:</strong> Many birds eat insects, helping humans in pest control.</li>
	              <li><strong>Control weeds:</strong> Birds species such as winches and sparrows eat weed seeds and in turn help in controlling unwanted plants.</li>
	              <li><strong>Reduce disease outbreaks and recycle nutrients:</strong> Scavenging bird species like eagle, vulture quickly disposes carcasses of dead animals and reduces the chances of spreading of diseases.</li>
	              <li><strong>Spread Fruit seeds:</strong> Fruit eating birds help spread all fruits by eating them and depositing the indigestible seeds all over the territory through their feces.</li>
	              <li><strong>Stimulate tourism:</strong> Bird migration to different places attracts people to their nesting areas.</li>
	          </ul> 
	          <h5>Birding</h5> 
	          <p class="description">
              	Bird watching can be done with the naked eye, using binoculars and telescopes or by listening for bird sounds. By watching birds we can interact more with them and learn to identify different types of birds based on their color, size, shape, behavior and habitat. 
              	</br></br>
              	The best time to observe birds is in the early morning between the time the Sun rises and mid- morning when birds are most active. Bird watching starts with observing local species and then moving to nearby locations. The greatest varieties of birds are seen during spring/ fall season when the birds migrate from different locations.  We arrange birdwatches during optimal conditions.

              <h4 class="title text-center"><a href="">OBSERVE NATURE</a></h4>
              <p class="description">
              	Human beings have to depend on nature for everything. What could be more wonderful than observing the cycle of the blooming of flowers, the bees seeking out flowers for nectar and pollinating them, leading to the next cycle? There are many such cycles, such as the flow of rivers into the sea, and the river again becoming robust due to monsoon downpours. These, and other cycles such as the changes in plant group and migratory patterns of fishes and birds let us know the state of the environment. Following these patterns is a step in sustainable living. We arrange Nature Walks, Treks and Forest Camps to observe nature and enrich your relationship with it.  
              </p>
              <h5>Why to Observe Nature?</h5> 
              <p class="description">
              	Have you ever thought of taking a break from the busy world of computers and technology and go out to observe the wonders of nature?
              	</br></br>
              	The chillness of the winter, the chirping sound of the birds, the orange-red sky during sunrise and sunset, the misty clouds, the bluish oceans, the smell of the first rains and many more wonders of the nature makes our Earth a lovely place  to live in.
              	</br></br>
              	As we are part of the nature, our body is tuned with the rhythms of the earth. Observation of nature has inspired mankind to invent and discover many things. Nature is the best search engine for creativity. Spending time with nature reduces our stress, develops inner peace, boosts creativity and finally makes our body and soul healthy and happy.
              	</br></br>
              	Observing nature opens the windows for new ideas and brings in a meaning for us to live this life. Connecting with nature through observation provides many opportunities to learn, boost our energy and creativity, gain wisdom, and receive guidance to solve difficult situations in our life.
              	</br></br>
              	For example a walk in the morning in a farm, leaving behind the concerns for the day, you may find butterflies, birds and small animals moving around you. Sit in the grass, take out some of your concerns, put it out to the universe, let the thought go and start observing your surroundings.  A butterfly may come and sit in a flower near you; a squirrel may climb up the trees nearby. Look at the little things closely by becoming an active partner, and ask the question how this may or may not relate to your concern. For example if your concern is “How am I going to improve my life?” and start observing the butterfly. The butterfly sits in flower collects nectar and moves out to another plant after some time. The butterfly also helps in pollinating the plant. Both the plant and the butterfly benefit mutually.
              	</br></br>
              	This might tell you that do your work in such a way that it benefits you as well as your company, family etc; and automatically your life will improve.
              	</br></br>
              	Join hands with us to spend time with nature; become an active participant in observing the nature for your personal growth and in turn protect the environment for a better future.

			  <h5>Benefits of planting trees</h5>
			  <ol class="ol-li-content">
	              <li><strong>Cut down your summer air conditioning costs:</strong> Planting trees in your surroundings provides shade and allows fresh air to peep into your house.</li>
	              <li><strong>Provide shelter and food for wildlife:</strong> Trees attract all types of wildlife from birds to squirrels.</li>
	              <li><strong>Reduce erosion and run off from storms:</strong> Pollution from storm runoffs spoils our waterways.Trees deflect 	rain, causing it to hit the ground slowly and increase absorption. Planting of trees reduces runoff, erosion and improves water quality. This increases the levels of ground water.</li>
	              <li><strong>Reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere:</strong> Trees absorb carbon dioxide and gives out oxygen, reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and slowing down global warming.</li>
	              <li><strong>Reduce air pollutants:</strong> Trees can remove both gaseous pollutants and airborne particles.</li>
	              <li><strong>Trees shield children from UV rays:</strong> Trees reduce the exposure to UV rays in school playgrounds and campuses, thus proving protection to children</li>
	              <li><strong>Reduce noise pollution:</strong> Trees also absorb sound and reduce noise pollution</li>
	              <li><strong>Trees mark the seasons:</strong> The changes in color of leaves in trees and the shedding of leaves mark the seasons.</li>
	              <li><strong>Trees provide medicines:</strong> Medicine from trees are extracted from the wood, bark, root, leaves flowers, fruits or seeds and are used to heal many common health issues, diseases.</li>
	              <li><strong>More paper and wood:</strong> Planting trees means more wood and paper which can be recycled easily.</li>

              <p class="description">
		           Olympiads are competitive exams conducted at the school level for students, based on the school curriculum. The present world is more competitive; these exams help in assessing the potential of children and prepare themselves for challenges in the future.
		           </br></br>
		           Olympiad exams are conducted by the government as well as private organizations. 
		           </br></br>
		           The international Olympiad movement is aimed at bringing the most talented secondary and higher secondary students of the world together in a friendly competition of the highest level. The Olympiads do not lead directly to any career benefits; rather, they provide a stimulus to begin a career in science or mathematics, to undertake a lifelong journey into the realms of exciting intellectual challenges.
		           </br></br>
		           The scientific community of India recognizes the need for a national Olympiad program in mathematics and basic sciences, which would lead to participation in the international Olympiads. India has been participating in the international Olympiads in Mathematics since 1989, and later started participation in Physics (1998), Chemistry (1999), Biology (2000), Astronomy (1999) and Junior Science (2007) as well. Enrollment of students in each subject has grown steadily over time, and currently stands at between 15000 and 50000 in different subjects. The Olympiads are conducted by Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), a national centre of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). The Olympiad program is run in close collaboration with the teacher associations, the Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT), Association of Chemistry Teachers (ACT), and the Association of Teachers in Biological Sciences (ATBS). The first stage of the Olympiad examinations is conducted by IAPT, while the later stages are the responsibility of HBCSE.
		      </p>
		      <h5>The science Olympiad exams are conducted in 5 stages:</h5>
		      <ol class="ol-li-content">
	              <li>Stage 1: NSE- National standard examination will be conducted in major cities across the nation by IAPT in the month of November every year. Around 15000-50000 students take part in this competition conducted for classes XI and XII, comprised of theoretical objective questions.</li>
	              <li>Stage 2: Indian National Olympiad- The best-performing students from the NSEs (approximately 300 in each subject) qualify for the second stage — the Indian National Olympiads (INOs). The responsibility of the program from this stage onwards lies with HBCSE. The INOs are held in late January at around 18 centers across the country. The syllabus is same as that of the NSEs. The tests consist of objective as well as long questions.</li>
	              <li>Stage 3: The top students from the INOs (approximately 35 in each subject) are invited for the third stage, the Orientation-cum-Selection Camps (OCSCs) held at HBCSE during April to June.. On the basis of performance in these tests, few students (numbers specified below) are selected to represent India at the international Olympiads.</li>
	              <li>Stage 4: The selected Indian teams undergo a rigorous training program at HBCSE in theory and experiment and in case of astronomy, observational astronomy prior to their departure for the international Olympiads. </li>
	              <li>Stage 5: The Olympiad program culminates with the participation of the Indian students (4-6 in each subject) in the International Olympiads. The students are accompanied by 2-4 teachers or mentors. </li>
	           </ol>
	           <h5>Similarly the mathematical Olympiad is conducted in 6 stages as given below:</h5>
		      <ol class="ol-li-content">
	           	  <li>Stage 1: Pre regional mathematical Olympiad</li>
	              <li>Stage 2: Regional  mathematical Olympiad</li>
	              <li>Stage 3: Indian National mathematical Olympiad</li>
	              <li>Stage 4: International mathematical Olympiad training camp</li>
	              <li>Stage 5: Pre departure camp</li>
	              <li>Stage 6: International mathematical olympiad</li>
	          </ol>

              <p class="description">
		           Choosing a career is one of the most decisions everyone has to take in their life. It is important to understand that choosing a career does not mean just selecting a career field based upon your interests, you should also have the abilities to get a job in that field and have the potential to grow with that career to achieve success. 
		           </br></br>
		            That is why it is very important for every student to understand what Aptitude is and why an aptitude test for career selection is important when tracing your path towards success and growth. Aptitude is defined as the ability of a person to perform certain tasks. Every career option requires a particular aptitude combination that should match with the individual’s potential ability to match with that career.
		           </br></br>
		           Aptitude tests are a way of testing a candidate for his/her abilities to do certain tasks and react to different situations. Every question is nothing but a situation which you are supposed to solve with basic understanding of mathematics. In the class, students have very little hands on experience of real life situations while on job this is something which is required all the time.
		           </br></br>
		           The most common types of tests are numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, quantitative aptitude and data interpretation. Our experts are people from different fields who are successful in their career and have a better knowledge of applying their knowledge to tackle real world problems in a smoother way. We train candidates for all the variants of aptitude tests and guide people towards career development.
